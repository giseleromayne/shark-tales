        "facts": "This is a myth about the freindship and betrayal of a monkey and a shark. The tale begins with the blossoming of freindship between the mokey and the shark. They monkey would drop down fruit for the shark to eat, and the shark eventually comes to invite the monkey to a feast under the sea. However, when the monkey learns of the sharks true intentions to take the monkey's heart, the monkey strikes back with a trick to get the shark to bring him back to the tree. This story does not portray sharks or monkeys as evil, and shines a neutral light on the both of them.",

        "facts": "The Atlantic Slave Trade has a lot of untaught horrors which are still being recovered, one of which involved the fear tactic of sharks for slaves on boats. Transporters would throw slaves overboard, sometimes baiting the water first, for a variety of reasons, including food shortages, disciplinary actions, sadistic pleasure, setting of examples, etc. This ingrained a fear of sharks in not only enslaved culture, but in the culture of the slave owners and citizens who heard the tales of the boats. This reinforced in society the mysticism of sharks and the power that they held. Many artists took these events and accounts and made works based off of the trauma and fear these people thrown overboard experienced.",

When the mother-in-law caught wind of this, she turned her other daughter into a shark and trained her to harm Abassi. When the time was right, the sister sawed of Abassi's leg with her teeth, which then became Orion's Belt.",
