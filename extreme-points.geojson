        "facts": "This is a myth about the freindship and betrayal of a monkey and a shark. The tale begins with the blossoming of freindship between the mokey and the shark. The monkey would drop down fruit for the shark to eat, and the shark eventually comes to invite the monkey to a feast under the sea. \n \n However, when the monkey learns of the shark's true intentions to take the monkey's heart, the monkey strikes back with a trick to get the shark to bring him back to the tree. \n \n This story does not portray sharks or monkeys as evil, and shines a neutral light on the both of them. \n \n In Tanzania, the respect held for the ocean and for sharks can be seen in the fact that 96% of total marine production is from small, artesinal fisheries. \n \n Although there is underreporting due to a lack of government fish landing beach recorders, it can be seen that the older style of catching fish and sharks that the people of Tanzania have is more sustainable than commercial fisheries.",

Many artists took these events and accounts and made works based off of the trauma and fear these people thrown overboard experienced.",

When the mother-in-law caught wind of this, she turned her other daughter into a shark and trained her to harm Abassi. \n \n When the time was right, the sister sawed off Abassi's leg with her teeth. Legend has it that the leg then became Orion's Belt. \n \n  This negative image of sharks as tools of distruction could be used as a cultural explanation for the illegal killing of more than 300,000 sharks off of the coast of Brazil each year.",

The language developed over time with the help of the surrounding bodies of water and the creatures found within. \n \n The oldest myth that comes from these people is called the Tiger Shark Dreaming, which is 40,000 years old. It details the journey of a tiger shark, who begins the tale having a very bad day. The tiger shark was being picked on by the other sharks and fish, and finally decided to take some of his hammerhead and stingray friends, and haul off the find a new place to call home. This journey created the rivers, water holes, and formations of Australia today. \n \n The Yanyuwa people have just recently gotten some land back from the Australian government which was taken during the attempted genocide against the aboriginal people of Australia. The land was given back in order to help the prosperity and vivacity of the people and the surrouding wildlife. \n \n Australia as a whole catches over 1200 tonnes of shark each year, where as aboriginal people account to little to none of that figure. This is because of their respect and honor shown to sharks in their culture and language.",

China kills an estimated 100 millions sharks a year, which mainly go to feed the tradition of shark fin soup.",
